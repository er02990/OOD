# OOD
This is a repository set up for our final project in OOD. We should get updates everytime some one pushes to this repository, so that should help with task managment.
The task list will be located in the Discord. Hopefully all of this will make doing this project easier and increase communication between us.
The discord is also going to be divided up into a "play" section and a "work" section.
